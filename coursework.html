          <h3>Diabetic Readmission Prediction</h3>
          <div class="time">Duration: Mid Mar 2025 – Apr 2025</div>
          <p>
            Designed a pipeline that cleans hospital records, tests hypotheses, engineers risk features,
            and trains ensemble models to flag patients likely to be readmitted within 30 days.
            The analysis highlights prior inpatient visits and overall utilization as the strongest signals
            and discusses fairness trade-offs and threshold choices for clinical use.

          <h3>Wildlife Strike Analytics</h3>
          <div class="time">Duration: Mid Mar 2025 – Apr 2025</div>
          <p>
            Built an analysis pipeline that cleans FAA wildlife-strike records, visualizes trends, and tests
            hypotheses to identify where and when risk concentrates. The study shows highest risk near large
            coastal airports and migration corridors—especially during approach/landing at ~140–160&nbsp;kt—
            and uses a simple trend model (AWP region, 1990–2015) to forecast 2016–2020 while noting limits
            of linear extrapolation. Findings inform airport-adjacent mitigation and season-aware planning.
