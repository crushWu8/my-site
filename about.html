        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="greet">Hey, how’s it going? I’m Shanghao, and I love math.</p>

        <p>
          I am a data-driven mathematics student who treats numbers as a language for seeing the world more clearly.
          My experience spans statistical analysis, database management, and visualization.
          I use Python and MySQL to turn noisy datasets into stories that guide decisions and move work forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          My faith shapes how I work. I try to pursue truth with humility, serve others with integrity, and keep results honest even when they are inconvenient.
          I enjoy the craft of modeling: framing questions, choosing features, testing assumptions, and translating results into actions that improve a process today.
          I like to try things. I build small prototypes, run careful experiments, ask for rapid feedback, and learn from what does not work.
          I am drawn to new ideas and fresh perspectives because they open new doors.
          I read widely and borrow insights from fields such as public health and urban mobility to sharpen my thinking and connect mathematics to real life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regression, time series, clustering, and experimental design are tools I reach for often, but curiosity is the engine behind them and ethics provides the steering.
          I care about reproducibility, clean code, and visual clarity, because insight should be as trustworthy as it is elegant.
          I thrive on collaboration with domain experts and I enjoy mentoring peers and writing concise notes that make complex ideas approachable.
          Mathematics is beautiful to me, and also useful, kind, and practical.
          If you cannot find me after class, check the nearest soccer field. I am the midfielder still thinking about gradients while chasing the ball.
